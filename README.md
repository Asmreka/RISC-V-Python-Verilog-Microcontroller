# RISC-V-Python-Verilog-Microcontroller

This repo contains all the code for the Python/Verilog microcontroller architecture.

## Usage

Inside the "Senior Project - RISC-V Microcontroller" folder you can find two folders, python and verilog. Inside each one is the full python/verilog design the microcontroller components and the fully-built microcontroller. Most (if not all) python files contain their own testbench at the bottom. As for the verilog code, you have to create your own testbench.
